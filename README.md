This project is designed to help people in need by creating an easy-to-use website. On this platform, users can upload details about individuals who require assistance. By sharing these stories, the website connects those in need with potential donors, making it simple to offer helpâ€”whether through financial donations, essential supplies, or other forms of support. This community-driven approach aims to bring people together to make a real difference in the lives of others.
